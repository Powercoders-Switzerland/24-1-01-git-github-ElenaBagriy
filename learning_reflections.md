# Learning Reflections

## What I Learned
- I learned the basics of Git and GitHub, including how to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage repositories.
- I gained a better understanding of repositories, branches, forks, pull requests, and issues.

## What I'm Still Confused About
- I'm still a bit confused about the branching and merging in Git.
- It is not tottally clear in which case should I use comments and add new files.
- I would like to learn more about advanced GitHub features like project boards and GitHub Actions.

## Experimenting with Styles
- I experimented with different markdown styles, including headers, lists, and emphasis (e.g., **bold** and *italic* text).

Overall, I'm excited to continue exploring Git and GitHub and to further enhance my collaboration and version control skills!
